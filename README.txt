This zip includes the datasets and sample codes of the paper "LSTM-Based Predictive mmWave Beam Tracking via Sub-6 GHz Channels for V2I Communications".

The folder named 'data' includes the datasets for training and testing in the co-located and HetNet scenarios, repectively.

BT_colocated.py is the sample code for the beam tracking via sub-6 GHz CSI in the co-located scenario.

BT_hetnet.py is the sample code for the beam tracking via sub-6 GHz CSI in the co-located scenario.

math_models.py contains some math functions.

model.py includes the neural networks used for the beam tracking via sub-6 GHz CSI in the co-located scenario.

model_fusion.py includes the neural networks used for the beam tracking via sub-6 GHz CSI in the HetNet scenario.

The datasets are uploaded on my Google drive, i.e., https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R--q5pVpFIB4Uu3sl_StcopnIeruocX8/view?usp=drive_link
